This is a Bank System project that 

1. Used OOP concpets to simulate real world Bank, Account, and ATM objects;

2. Used property and indexes;

3. Used inheritance from Account class to a CreditAccount subclass, and added
fields, properties, as well as overriding the WithdrawMoney method;

4. Implemented a BigMoneyFetched event, when more than 10,000 number of 
money is withdrawn. ATM declares this Event using Delegate. This event is 
registered in main.

5. Defined a inner exception type BadCashException that happens when an ATM 
returns a bad cash to the user. This exception is thrown in ATM class and 
caught in main.
